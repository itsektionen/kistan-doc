# Backup Admin Access

It is possible that a miss-configuration of the service results in the Google
SAML login to stop working. To avoid total lockout there is a secondary way to
log in with a local account.

To access the fallback method go to [https://sso-admin.kth.it/if/admin][1] and sign
in with the local account credentials.
